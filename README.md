# Express TypeScript Template

This is a template for quickly setting up typescript with express and running it

## Setup

First install all necessary packages

```
pnpm install
```

Finally, run it using `dev`

```
pnpm dev
```

## Structure

Everything is already segregated,

- `controllers/` directory for all controllers
- `routes/` directory for all routes/routers
- `routes/index.ts` file for adding all routers created
- `middleware/` directory for all middlewares
